Here are some possible essay questions.  Choose one.  You are allowed to come up with your own question, but be sure to clear it with me first.  Essays should be around three to four pages in 12-point font, double-spaced (not including the bibliography).  As with the essay samples that I have included on Brightspace, you do not need a title-page; instead, you just need to include your name, student number, course number, your teaching assistant's name, and the date in the top right hand corner of the first page.  
Your essay should have a title that reflects not only your topic but your argument about that topic; an introductory paragraph that introduces your topic, suggests how it will be approached in regards to the text, and closes with a clear and specific thesis statement; supporting paragraphs organized around points that support your thesis and that open with a strong topic sentence; specific evidence from the primary text itself; a sense of sound and logical transition from supporting point to supporting point; and a strong conclusion that reinforces your thesis and suggests something about its wider implications.  The essay samples on Brightspace are very clear in regards to what I am looking for, so be sure to look over these before and while writing.  
Be specific, be organized, and be sure to make good use of the text when making your case. When it comes to quoting from the text, be sure to comment on the quotes you use and incorporate them into your larger argument.
